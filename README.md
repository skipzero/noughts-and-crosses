Noughts and Crosses (tic tac toe) with react.js

## About this game

We've developed this little game while trying out ReactJS and while looking at examples, and not knowing what to do about the computer AI (it is a single player game only, of course), read about the Monte Carlo Simulation: [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)

So that's going to be our AI once I get it done! ;p

till then, follow the instructions below to play with whatever is done at this time!

Enjoy! :)
